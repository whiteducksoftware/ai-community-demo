Please create a repository on GitHub for the simple Task Management Web Application. Set up the repository first with a Readme.md, labels, descriptions etc. Think of a fitting repository name. After that is done, please create the initial scaffolding for the project, using sequential pull requests and merge them. Once you have done that, create issues based on the roadmap for the project so the developers know with which task to do next. Merge PullRequests at your own disgression. Stop after you've implemented the basic setup.
